# GlobalEnderChest
GlobalEnderChest is a small mod which *enforces a global inventory for ender chests rather than the per-player system currently in the game*. This mod is probably best suited for small servers to alleviate the hassle of keeping track of resources stored in friends' personal ender chest inventories. GlobalEnderChest is simple but designed to be flexibleâ€”specifically:

## Features
- **Replaces all personal ender inventories with a global instance** *(the contents of such are accessible for all players on a server)*.
- **Personal ender inventory migration assistance** *(players will require emptying their existing personal inventory before being allowed to access the global instance)*.
- ***(Not a feature yet)*** **Optional hybrid functionality** *(If enabled for a server, personal ender inventory behavior will remain; sneaking while accessing an ender chest will allow the player to access the global instance)*.
